Implementation and configuration of the SDR-based communication system using GNU Radio, including both FSK and GMSK modulation schemes. This part of the project covers the design of end-to-end transmitter and receiver flowgraphs, integration with USRP-2920 and HackRF One devices, and setup of framing (HDLC), scrambling, and NRZI coding for robust data transmission. It also includes the transition from initial FSK tests to a final GMSK-based link, selected for its better trade-off between spectral efficiency and robustness, enabling reliable transmission of images and text over real RF channels.
