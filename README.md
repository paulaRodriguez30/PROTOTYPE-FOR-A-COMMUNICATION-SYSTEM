Analysis and characterization of the propagation environment and TV White Spaces (TVWS) spectrum prior to SDR system deployment. This includes frequency sweeps to identify occupied and vacant channels, measurements with a controlled transmission signal, and assessment of terrain and propagation conditions to select suitable operating frequencies and realistic parameters for subsequent SDR link implementation and testing.
