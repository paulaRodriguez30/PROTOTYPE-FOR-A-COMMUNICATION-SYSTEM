# Prototype for a Communication System over TV White Spaces (TVWS)

This repository contains the complete development of an SDR-based communication system for reliable transmission of images and text over **TV White Spaces (TVWS)**.  
It includes spectrum analysis, environment characterization, GNU Radio simulations, SDR implementation with USRP-2920 and HackRF One, and real-world transmission/reception tests.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to **design, implement, and evaluate** a digital communication system using **Software Defined Radio (SDR)** to transmit medical-related images and text reliably over unused TV broadcast channels (TVWS).

The work covers:

- Analysis and characterization of the **electromagnetic environment** and TVWS spectrum.
- Design of a **complete baseband chain**: framing, coding, modulation, channel modeling, and BER estimation.
- Implementation of the system in **GNU Radio Companion (GRC)**.
- Validation in **simulation** and in **real hardware** using USRP-2920 and HackRF One.
- Comparison and analysis of measurement data using **Python / Jupyter / Google Colab**.

## 🎯 Main Objectives

- Identify **available TVWS channels** suitable for experimental communication.
- Implement an SDR-based communication system supporting:
  - Text transmission
  - Image transmission
- Evaluate the system in:
  - Controlled **simulation environments**
  - **Real RF channels** (coaxial link + over-the-air)
- Optimize transmission parameters for **robustness and low bit error rate (BER)**.

## 🧱 System Architecture (High-Level)

The communication system is built around:

- **Framing:** HDLC-based frames (flags, length, CRC/FCS).
- **Pre-processing:** scrambling / descrambling and **NRZI** coding / decoding.
- **Modulation schemes:**
  - FSK / GFSK (used in early tests and simulations)
  - **GMSK** (final scheme selected for real SDR experiments)
- **Channel models:**
  - Virtual channel in GNU Radio (noise, frequency offset, timing offset, multipath).
  - Physical channel using:
    - Coaxial cable (C4, 24.38 m, ~26.70 dB + 30 dB attenuator)
    - Over-the-air links with 400 MHz–1 GHz antennas.
- **Receivers:**
  - AGC + filtering → demodulation → NRZI decode → descrambling → HDLC deframing.
  - Recovery of text or image files and BER estimation.
